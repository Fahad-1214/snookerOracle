Our public database is also used by darts fans all over the world who like to browse darts statistics, records, or have a punt on the sport.

We believe everybody can improve on what they do if they have the right data to take them in the right direction. If they don’t, they will eventually fall behind. What you don’t know will hurt you.

            One Connected, Worldwide Ranking System
            Our FDI (Faria Darting Index) rating and ranking system is the only recognised ranking system in the world that connects players from every form of the game in one list. Quite simply, if you play darts and your data is accessible to us, you will have a rating placing you in the pecking order with everybody including the very best. FDI ratings can be used to decide the right calibre of opponent for practice, as seedings for tournaments and unlike normal ranking systems, is a true reflection of form due to the rapid nature with which it updates. Any player can join the community in our Darts Orakel Play app and get your own rating by playing matches. The more you play, the more accurate it will be.
